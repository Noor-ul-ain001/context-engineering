## 🧩 What is Prompt Engineering?

* **Definition**: The skill of crafting clear, structured instructions that guide an LLM toward the desired output.
* **Analogy**: Learning how to talk to AI in its “language” so it understands exactly what you want.
* **Why it matters**:

  * You don’t need to code to use it effectively.
  * The same model can give bad or excellent results depending on the prompt.
  * Iterative skill → improves with practice.
  * Core productivity skill in 2025 and beyond.

## ⚖️ Prompt vs. Context Engineering

| Aspect           | Prompt Engineering                                   | Context Engineering                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**         | Tell the model what to do, how to format output      | Provide facts/examples the model should use |
| **Levers**       | Wording, roles, constraints, output schema, few-shot | RAG, docs, APIs, memory, state across turns |
| **Failure Mode** | Vague → messy or wrong output                        | Missing/irrelevant context → hallucinations |
| **Ownership**    | UX & app devs                                        | Data/ML/platform teams                      |
| **Together**     | Prompt = behavior contract                           | Context = knowledge grounding               |

**One-liner:**
👉 *Prompt engineering is how you ask; context engineering is what you show.*

## ⚙️ Key LLM Settings

* **Temperature**: Controls creativity vs. determinism.

  * `0`: factual, consistent.
  * `0.7`: balanced.
  * `0.9`: creative, but risky.
* **Top-K & Top-P**: Limit randomness in word choice.
* **Max Tokens**: Controls response length/cost.

## 🛠️ Core Prompting Techniques

1. **Zero-shot** → Ask directly.
2. **One-shot** → Give 1 example.
3. **Few-shot** → Give 3–5 examples for pattern.
4. **System prompting** → Set model’s “persona” & rules.
5. **Role prompting** → Assign expertise/character.
6. **Contextual prompting** → Give relevant background.

## 🚀 Advanced Strategies

* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: “Think step by step.”
* **Self-consistency**: Ask multiple times, pick most common.
* **Step-back prompting**: Ask a general → then specific.
* **ReAct**: Mix reasoning with actions (e.g., tool calls).
* **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**: Explore multiple solution branches.

## 🏗️ Best Practices

* Be **specific & clear** → “Write 300 words…” not “Write about dogs.”
* Use **action verbs**: Analyze, summarize, extract, list, etc.
* Give **examples** (esp. for structured data).
* Define **output schemas** (e.g., JSON).
* **Iterate & document** → A/B test prompt variations.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

* Vague instructions → inconsistent results.
* Contradictions → confuse model.
* Too many constraints → kills creativity.
* Ignoring token limits → output cutoff.
* Not testing variations → missed improvements.

## 🔮 Future (2025 & Beyond): MoE + Prompting

* **MoE (Mixture-of-Experts)** → only activates relevant parts of the model.
* Prompting impact:

  * Domain-specific hints (“As a math expert…”) improve routing.
  * Stepwise breakdown activates the right experts.
  * Stochastic routing → need consistency checks (temperature=0, ensembles).
  * Concise prompts work better with expert specialization.

✅ If you just want a **mental shortcut**:

* **Prompt = clear task instructions**
* **Context = relevant knowledge provided**
* **Together = reliable AI apps**
